# Intersection Observer Example for Nuxt3

This is an implementation of a custom directive for Nuxt3 that utilizes the intersection observer API.
The custom directive "v-intersect" allows you to execute custom callback functions when a component enter or leaves the viewport.
In addition, you can customize this behaviour by setting a view time threshold and an area threshold to configure how long a component has to be in the viewport / how much area has to overlap with the viewport.
